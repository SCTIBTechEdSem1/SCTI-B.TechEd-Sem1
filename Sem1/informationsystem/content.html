        <tr><td><strong>2. Processor Organization:</strong>
            The processor, or central processing unit (CPU), is the heart of the computer system.
             It consists of the control unit, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and registers. The control unit fetches instructions, decodes them, 
             and coordinates the execution of operations. The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations on data. Registers store data and instructions for fast access.

            Computers use different levels of memory with varying speeds and capacities to optimize performance. The memory hierarchy includes cache memory, which provides 
            fast access to frequently used data, and main memory (RAM) for storing data and instructions. Storage devices like hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs) provide long-term storage.

        <tr><td><strong>6. Parallelism and Pipelining: </strong>
            To improve performance, computer architectures utilize parallelism and pipelining techniques. Parallelism involves executing multiple instructions simultaneously, either by using multiple 
            processors (multiprocessing) or by dividing instructions into independent subtasks (instruction-level parallelism). Pipelining breaks down instructions into stages, allowing multiple instructions to be processed concurrently in different stages.

            ROM is used to store essential system instructions, such as the computer's boot-up process

            A LAN is a network that covers a small geographical area, typically within a single building or a group of nearby buildings. LANs are commonly found in homes, offices, schools, and small businesses. Here are some key characteristics of LANs:<br><br>
            <strong>• Size and Scope:</strong> LANs are limited in size and usually cover a small area, such as a single room, floor, or building.<br><br>
            <strong>• Ownership and Control:</strong> LANs are typically privately owned and controlled by a single organization or individual.<br><br>
            <strong>• Connectivity:</strong> LANs use wired or wireless connections to interconnect devices within the network. Ethernet cables and Wi-Fi are common technologies used for LAN connectivity.<br><br>
            <strong>• Speed and Bandwidth:</strong> LANs offer high-speed data transfer rates, often reaching gigabit speeds. This allows for quick communication and file sharing between devices.<br><br>
            <strong>• Security:</strong> LANs typically have local security measures in place to protect the network from unauthorized access. Firewalls, access control, and encryption are commonly used for LAN security.<br><br>

        </td></tr>

        <tr><td><strong>2. Wide Area Network (WAN):</strong>
            A WAN is a network that covers a large geographic area, connecting LANs or other networks over long distances. WANs are often used to connect multiple offices or branches of an organization spread across different locations. Here are some key characteristics of WANs:<br><br>
            <strong>• Geographic Coverage:</strong> WANs cover a wide area, such as a city, country, or even multiple countries. They can span across continents as well.<br><br>
            <strong>• Public Infrastructure:</strong> WANs utilize public network infrastructure, such as leased lines, fiber-optic cables, and satellite links, to connect geographically dispersed locations.<br><br>
            <strong>• Speed and Bandwidth:</strong> WANs typically offer lower data transfer rates compared to LANs due to the longer distances and reliance on public infrastructure. However, modern WAN technologies like MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) and broadband connections have improved WAN speeds.<br><br>
            <strong>• Ownership and Control:</strong> WANs can be privately owned by organizations or provided by telecommunications companies as a service.<br><br>
            <strong>• Security:</strong> WANs require robust security measures to protect data during transmission over public networks. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), encryption, and secure protocols are commonly used for WAN security.<br><br>
            <strong>• Examples:</strong> Connecting multiple branch offices of a company, linking a company's headquarters with its data center, or accessing the internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP) are examples of WAN usage.<br><br>
