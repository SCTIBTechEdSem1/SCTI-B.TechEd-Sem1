        <tr><td><strong>2. Processor Organization:</strong>
            The processor, or central processing unit (CPU), is the heart of the computer system.
             It consists of the control unit, arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and registers. The control unit fetches instructions, decodes them, 
             and coordinates the execution of operations. The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations on data. Registers store data and instructions for fast access.

            Computers use different levels of memory with varying speeds and capacities to optimize performance. The memory hierarchy includes cache memory, which provides 
            fast access to frequently used data, and main memory (RAM) for storing data and instructions. Storage devices like hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs) provide long-term storage.

        <tr><td><strong>6. Parallelism and Pipelining: </strong>
            To improve performance, computer architectures utilize parallelism and pipelining techniques. Parallelism involves executing multiple instructions simultaneously, either by using multiple 
            processors (multiprocessing) or by dividing instructions into independent subtasks (instruction-level parallelism). Pipelining breaks down instructions into stages, allowing multiple instructions to be processed concurrently in different stages.

            ROM is used to store essential system instructions, such as the computer's boot-up process

        A language processor, also known as a language translator, is a type of software tool or program that converts human-readable source code 
        written in a programming or scripting language into machine-executable code. It acts as an intermediary between the source code and the 
        computer hardware, enabling the computer to understand and execute the instructions written in the programming language.

        <tr><td><strong>1.Compiler:</strong>
            A compiler is a language processor that translates the entire source code written in a programming language into machine code 
            in one go. It performs various tasks, including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, code optimization, and code generation. The output of a compiler is an executable file that can be directly run by the computer's hardware.
        </td></tr>

        <tr><td><strong>2. Interpreter:</strong>
            An interpreter reads and executes the source code line by line, converting it into machine code on the fly. It does not produce a standalone executable file like a compiler. Instead, it directly executes the instructions in the source code 
            and provides the output. Interpreted languages include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.
        </td></tr>

        <tr><td><strong>3. Assembler:</strong>
            An assembler is a language processor specifically designed for low-level programming languages, such as assembly language. It translates assembly language code, which is a human-readable representation of machine code, into binary machine 
            code that can be directly executed by the computer's hardware.

    <thead><tr><th>Here are some key points about device drivers:</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>1. Hardware Interaction:</strong>
            Device drivers enable the operating system to interact with various hardware components, such as printers, scanners, 
            graphics cards, network adapters, sound cards, and input devices (e.g., keyboards, mice). Each hardware device requires
            a specific driver to establish communication and enable the OS to control and utilize its functionalities.
        </td></tr>

        <tr><td><strong>2. Abstraction Layer:</strong>
            Device drivers create an abstraction layer between the hardware and the operating system. They provide a standardized interface, 
            allowing the OS to send commands and receive data from the hardware without needing to understand the intricacies of each device's 
            implementation.
        </td></tr>

        <tr><td><strong>3.Driver Development:</strong>
            Device drivers are typically developed by the manufacturer of the hardware device. Manufacturers provide drivers specific to 
            their hardware, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance. Operating system developers also create generic drivers for 
            common device types to support a wide range of devices out of the box.
        </td></tr>

        <tr><td><strong>4. Functionality and Control:</strong>
            Device drivers enable the operating system to control the behavior and features of hardware devices. They provide functions 
            and instructions for tasks such as initializing the device, configuring settings, managing power usage, performing data 
            transfers, and handling interrupts or events generated by the hardware.
        </td></tr>

        <tr><td><strong>5. Plug and Play:</strong>
            Device drivers play a crucial role in the Plug and Play (PnP) functionality of modern operating systems. 
            When a new hardware device is connected, the operating system detects it and automatically installs the appropriate driver, 
            allowing the device to be recognized and used without manual intervention.
        </td></tr>

        <tr><td><strong>6. Updates and Compatibility:</strong>
            Device drivers may require updates over time to improve performance, fix bugs, or add new features. Operating system updates 
            may also include updated drivers to enhance compatibility and support for newer hardware devices.
