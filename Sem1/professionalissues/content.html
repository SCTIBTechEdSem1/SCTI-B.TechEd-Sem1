        <tr><td>
          The concept of organization refers to a structured entity or system composed of individuals who come together to achieve common objectives. Organizations can take various forms, such as businesses, non-profit organizations, government agencies, educational institutions, and more. They have defined structures, roles, and processes to facilitate the coordination and collaboration of individuals towards the achievement of shared goals.
          A goal within an organization is a desired outcome or target that the organization aims to accomplish. It provides direction and purpose to the organization's activities, guiding decision-making, resource allocation, and performance evaluation. Goals can be short-term or long-term, specific or general, and they can encompass various aspects, such as financial performance, market share, customer satisfaction, innovation, social impact, and more.
          Goal displacement, on the other hand, refers to a phenomenon that occurs when an organization or its members shift their focus from the original goals towards secondary or alternative objectives. It happens when individuals within the organization prioritize or emphasize goals that are not aligned with the primary purpose or mission of the organization.
        </td></tr>

      <tr><th>There are several reasons why goal displacement may occur:</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td><strong>1. External factors:</strong>
          Changes in the external environment, such as shifts in market conditions, regulatory requirements, or stakeholder expectations, can lead to a reevaluation of goals and the emergence of new priorities.
        </td></tr>

        <tr><td><strong>2. Internal dynamics:</strong>
          Within the organization, conflicts of interest, power struggles, or personal agendas of individuals or groups can drive goal displacement. This can happen when individuals pursue their own objectives at the expense of the organization's overarching goals.
        </td></tr>
        
        <tr><td><strong>3. Measurement and reward systems:</strong>
          In some cases, the metrics or incentives used to assess performance and reward individuals within the organization may inadvertently encourage goal displacement. If employees are primarily rewarded based on a single metric (e.g., sales volume), they may prioritize achieving that metric over other important goals, potentially leading to goal displacement.
        </td></tr>

        <tr><td><strong>4. Organizational culture and values:</strong>
          If the organization lacks a strong culture that emphasizes and reinforces its core goals and values, goal displacement can occur. When there is a lack of clarity or commitment to the primary objectives, individuals may pursue their own interpretations of what is important.
        </td></tr>

        <tr><td><strong>Note: </strong>
          Goal displacement can have both positive and negative consequences. On one hand, it can lead to innovation, adaptation to changing circumstances, and the pursuit of new opportunities. On the other hand, it can undermine the organization's overall effectiveness, coherence, and long-term success if it results in a loss of focus, misalignment, or neglect of critical objectives.
          To mitigate goal displacement, organizations should establish clear and meaningful goals, communicate them effectively throughout the organization, align performance measurement and reward systems with the primary goals, foster a strong organizational culture that emphasizes shared values, and regularly monitor and evaluate goal attainment to ensure ongoing alignment and adjustment when necessary.

          The relationship between organization and management:
          Management is the process of coordinating and directing the activities of an organization to achieve its goals. It is the means through which an organization functions and operates effectively. Without management, an organization would lack direction, coordination, and control.<br><br>
          On the other hand, an organization provides the structure and context within which management takes place. It provides the framework for managers to allocate resources, set goals, establish processes, and lead individuals toward achieving desired outcomes. The organization sets the boundaries and scope within which management functions are performed.<br><br>
          In summary, organization and management are interrelated concepts that go hand in hand. An organization provides the structure and purpose, while management ensures the effective and efficient use of resources, coordination of activities, and achievement of goals.
